the gamma' phase has a slightly difference lattice constant 

if a is the lattice constant of the gamma phase

and a' is the lattice constant of the gamma' pahse

misfit = 2(a'-a)/(a'+a)

this is like a strain

change in lattice constant / (average) lattice constant

to fit the gamma' into gamma, you then need to stretch/contract the gamma pahse

this causes a stress field

the way we represent this field is with Eshelby's inclusion theory

for that we need an eigendistortion tensor corresponding to the misfit

since the misfit is volumetric

the tensor would be isotropic

so its an eigendistortion tensor with the misfit on the diagonal elements

Eshelby's inclusions fields are already coded

the expression for the fields are analytical for ellipsoidal inclusions

therefore also for spherical inclusions

the interesting thing is that the stress field inside an ellipsoidal inclusion is constant

so the gamma' is at constant stress

outside the inclusion there is a decaying field from the inclusion

so the stress field decays in from the inclusion in the gamma phase

long range stress.
