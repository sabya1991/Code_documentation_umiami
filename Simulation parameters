lmin=0.005, lmax=0.02 for 3000 size box
lmin=0.0025, lmax=0.01 for 6000 size box  (I think lmin and lmax are functions of the mesh size, so when we keep them same, 
                                           for larger box, I can see that segments are not smooth and can lead to higher 
                                           cutoff stress)
                                           
                                           
ExternalStrainRate=-1e-9 for f>0.2 approx
                  =-1e-10 otherwise 
                  
Slow strain rate matters a lot when the cutoff stress is less. 
Strain rate must be such that there is a stress drop when the cutoff event happens. 

Put ExternalStrain0 a little below the cutoff stress. Then apply as slow loading rate as possible.
