EshelbyInclusion.h: 
In function addSlipSystems, add insertion to gammaSurfaceMap. (refer to Model_gamma folder in Desktop)
Also, add part to create waveVectorInt (integer coordinate of WaveVector). Then call gammaSurface with overloaded constructor which has waveVectorInt. 

SlipSystem.h:
Add overloaded constructor for Gamma surface which takes in waveVecInt and then passes it to the overloaded constructor of PeriodicLatticeInterpolant. 
change const position in misfitenergy. 

PeriodicLatticeInterpolant.h : 
Add the constructor which has an overloaded constructor which takes integer coordinates of waveVectors called WaveVectorInt. Then it uses a function called 
getWaveVecFromIntCoord which multiplies waveVecInt with Bmod to give the WaveVector. 


MicrostructureGenerator.h : 
-> Added the part where a second partial is inserted inside the loop of the first partial (so that the order of the partials is correct)
-> removed randomSign in burgers vector in case of partials , also in case of full burgers vector (for our example only), see addSingleLoop function has false. 


DislocationQuadraturePoint.h: 
In function "updateForcesAndVelocities", add the part due to SF force. 
Add functions "isLeft" and "windingNumber". (refer to Model_gamma folder in Desktop)

FCCLattice.h: remove extra 0 from df. 
change nullptr in full dislocation slip system gamma surfaces just like in the case of partials (4 gammasurfaces)
