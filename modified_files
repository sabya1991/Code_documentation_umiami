EshelbyInclusion.h: 
In function addSlipSystems, add insertion to gammaSurfaceMap. (refer to Model_gamma folder in Desktop)
Also, add part to create waveVectorInt (integer coordinate of WaveVector). Then call gammaSurface with overloaded constructor which has waveVectorInt. 

SlipSystem.h:
Add overloaded constructor for Gamma surface which takes in waveVecInt and then passes it to the overloaded constructor of PeriodicLatticeInterpolant. 

PeriodicLatticeInterpolant.h : 
Add the constructor which has an overloaded constructor which takes integer coordinates of waveVectors called WaveVectorInt. Then it uses a function called 
getWaveVecFromIntCoord which multiplies waveVecInt with Bmod to give the WaveVector. 


MicrostructureGenerator.h : 
-> Added the part where a second partial is inserted inside the loop of the first partial (so that the order of the partials is correct)
-> removed randomSign in burgers vector in case of partials


DislocationQuadraturePoint.h: 
In function "updateForcesAndVelocities", add the part due to SF force. 
Add functions "isLeft" and "windingNumber". (refer to Model_gamma folder in Desktop)
