PeriodicLatticeInterpolant.h : 
Add the constructor which has waveVector

For the gamma phase, call PeriodicLatticeInterpolant without waveVector AND we use N1=N2=2. 
For the gamma' phase, call " with waveVector AND we use N1=N2=3. 

The waveVector needs to be constructed. In the test program, the matlab file makes it. In the code, we need to create it. 
(NEEDS TO BE DONE)
